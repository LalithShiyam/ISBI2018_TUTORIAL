    "**Summary:**\n",
    "1. SimpleITK supports a variety of spatial transformations (global or local) that can be used to augment your dataset via resampling directly from the original images (which vary in size).\n",
    "2. Resampling to a uniform size can be done either by specifying the desired sizes resulting in non-isotropic pixel spacings (most often) or by specifying an isotropic pixel spacing and one of the image sizes (width,height,depth). \n",
    "3. SimpleITK supports a variety of intensity transformations (blurring, adding noise etc.) that can be used to augment your dataset after it has been resampled to the size expected by your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the use of SimpleITK to perform data augmentation for deep learning. Note that the code is written so that the relevant functions work for both 2D and 3D images without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentation is a model based approach for enlarging your training set. The problem being addressed is that the original dataset is not sufficiently representative of the general population of images. As a consequence, if we only train on the original dataset the resulting network will not generalize well to the population (overfitting). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a model of the variations found in the general population and the existing dataset we generate additional images in the hope of capturing the population variability. Note that if the model you use is incorrect you can cause harm, you are generating observations that do not occur in the general population and are optimizing a function to fit them."

The reflection matrix is constructed using the plane, 3D,  or axis, 2D, which we want to reflect through with the standard basis vectors, $\\mathbf{e}_i, \\mathbf{e}_j$, and the remaining basis vector set to $-\\mathbf{e}_k$.  \n",

    "Using SimpleITK we can readily transfer deformations from a spatio-temporal data set to another spatial data set to simulate temporal behavior. Case in point, using a 4D (3D+time) CT of the thorax we can estimate the respiratory motion using non-rigid registration and Free Form Deformation or displacement field transformations. We can then register a new spatial data set to the original spatial CT (non-rigidly) followed by application of the temporal deformations.\n",

Also note that as the goal is to use the estimated transformations to create plausible deformations you may be able to relax the required registration accuracy."
