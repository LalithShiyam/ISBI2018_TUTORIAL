    "1. SimpleITK provides two flavors of non-rigid registration:\n",
    "   * Free Form Deformation, BSpline based, and Demons using the ITKv4 registration framework.\n",
    "   * A set of Demons filters that are independent of the registration framework (`DemonsRegistrationFilter, DiffeomorphicDemonsRegistrationFilter, FastSymmetricForcesDemonsRegistrationFilter, SymmetricForcesDemonsRegistrationFilter`).\n",
    "2. Registration evaluation:\n",
    "   * Registration accuracy, the quantity of interest is the Target Registration Error (TRE).\n",
    "   * TRE is spatially variant.\n",
    "   * Surrogate metrics for evaluating registration accuracy such as segmentation overlaps are relevant, but are potentially deficient.\n",
    "   * Registration time.\n",
    "   * Acceptable values for TRE and runtime are context dependent."
